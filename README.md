This is a "game" (there is no win or lose condition) that I made to 
practice the following:

Sound loading
Sound playing
Playing sound on event
Input handling
Image loading
Image manipulation with input
Collision detection with hitboxes was outside of the scope of this 
learning adventure so the ball goes through the paddles.

All "pixel art" is mine and is public domain. I wouldn't suggest using 
it though, it's bad.

Music is from opengameart.org
